  "readme": "# DHT.js\n\nTrue, complete implementation of [DHT Protocol][0] written in javascript for\nnode.js runtime.\n\n_Danger! This module is in development and isn't tested enough to use it in\nproduction!_\n\n## Motivation\n\nDHT is a great tool for storing and searching data, and is widely adopted and\nused in almost every existing torrent client. Since torrents are quite popular\nnowadays, being able to connect to that network, storing or finding data inside\nit can be really useful for building interesting distributed applications.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install dht.js\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar dht = require('dht.js');\n\n// Create DHT node (server)\nvar node = dht.node.create(/* optional UDP port there */);\n\n// Connect to known node in network\nnode.connect({\n  id: new Buffer(/* 160bit node id */), /* <-- optional */\n  address: '4.4.4.4',\n  port: 13589\n});\n\n// Tell everyone that you have services to advertise\nvar hash = new Buffer(/* 160 bit infohash */);\nnode.advertise(hash, 13589 /* port */);\n\n// Wait for someone to appear\nnode.on('peer:new', function (infohash, peer, isAdvertised) {\n  // Ignore other services\n  if (!isAdvertised) return;\n\n  console.log(peer.address, peer.port);\n\n  // Stop listening\n  node.close();\n\n  // Returns node's state as a javascript object\n  var state = node.save();\n\n  // Create node from existing state\n  var old = dht.node.create(state);\n\n  // Just cleaning up\n  old.close();\n});\n```\n\n### License\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2012.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
